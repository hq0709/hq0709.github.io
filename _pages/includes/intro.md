I am a first-year PhD student at University of Georgia, supervised by Distinguished Research Professor [Tianming Liu](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~tliu/). 

I am now working on Multi-modal Large Language Models, Medical Image Analysis. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [hanqi.jiang@uga.edu](hj67104@uga.edu). 

I graduated from [School of Computer and Information Technology](https://cs.bjtu.edu.cn/), Beijing Jiaotong University with a bachelor's degree of engineering and [School of Computing and Communications](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/), Lancaster University with a bachelor's degree of science (First-Class Honored). Prior to joining UGA, I interned at Li Auto, CUHKSZ, ICTCAS, Tsinghua University and Baidu. 


My research focus is medical image analysis and application of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in the field of healthcare. Specifically, I am focusing on 3D medical image encoding and video generation.
